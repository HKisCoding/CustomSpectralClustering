    """
    Compute the accuracy score of the clustering algorithm.

    Parameters
    ----------
    cluster_assignments : np.ndarray
        Cluster assignments for each data point.
    y : np.ndarray
        Ground truth labels.
    n_clusters : int
        Number of clusters.

    Returns
    -------
    float
        The computed accuracy score.

    Notes
    -----
    This function takes the `cluster_assignments` which represent the assigned clusters for each data point,
    the ground truth labels `y`, and the number of clusters `n_clusters`. It computes the accuracy score of the
    clustering algorithm by comparing the cluster assignments with the ground truth labels. The accuracy score
    is returned as a floating-point value.

    ----------
    cluster_assignments : np.ndarray
        Cluster assignments for each data point.
    y : np.ndarray
        Ground truth labels.

    Returns

    Notes
    -----
    This function takes the `cluster_assignments` which represent the assigned clusters for each data point
    and the ground truth labels `y`. It computes the normalized mutual information (NMI) score of the clustering
    algorithm. NMI measures the mutual dependence between the cluster assignments and the ground truth labels,
    normalized by the entropy of both variables. The NMI score ranges between 0 and 1, where a higher score
    indicates a better clustering performance. The computed NMI score is returned as a floating-point value.
